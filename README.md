# React Shopping Cart üìã
**<p>In this project, I made a shopping cart application with React. The project performs the basic functions of an e-commerce site: adding products to the cart, deleting them, clearing the list and increasing the product quantity. You can also access the product you want with the category filter tags and search filter. React uses data between components for basket operations. The Context API, which is the transfer tool, and the useReducer hook were used to keep the transactions more manageable. In addition, the basket information is stored in the local storage and you can see it even if you leave the site. In addition, the project has been made mobile compatible. If we list the features of the project:</p>**
<strong>
<ul>
  <li>Adding product to cart</li>
  <li>Delete all products from the cart or delete the desired product</li>
  <li>Product quantity increase and decrease options</li>
  <li>Product filtering options</li>
  <li>By storing the cart information in local storage, the information is available even if the site is exited.</li>
</ul>

## What is Context API ? 
**<p>Context API is a tool that facilitates state management in React applications. This API is used to enable the definition of global variables and the flow of data between different components. Context API facilitates data sharing by creating a structure that all components can access at a global level, instead of transferring states to subcomponents with the help of props. In this way, it makes it easier for developers to keep and update data that will be used in many parts of the application, especially theme information and user information. Using the Context API enables state management in React applications more effectively and cleanly.</p>**
